iOS 7 - Multipeer.Framework sample
(Under Development)
--

multipeer is just a sample about one of the new frameworks available in iOS 7 (Multipeer.framework).

multipeer gives an easy way to understand what are those new classes and interfaces (MCNearbyServiceBrowser, MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser, etc.); and how you can construct in a simple way great multipeer apps using simple NSDictionary or JSON structured messages.

multipeer works using bluetooth and Wifi communications (P2P) and you need several devices to test it (it also works in the simulator).

Usage:
------

multipeer is using cocoapods for managing its dependant libraries. You should install *pods* from: http://cocoapods.org
After that, just type in the project top folder:

    pod install

and you're done!
