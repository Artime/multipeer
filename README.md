iOS 7 - Multipeer.Framework sample

--

multipeer is just a sample about one of the new frameworks available in iOS 7 (Multipeer.framework).

multipeer gives an easy way to understand what are those new classes and interfaces (MCNearbyServiceBrowser, MCNearbyServiceAdvertiser, etc.); and how you can construct in a simple way great multipeer apps using simple JSON messages.

multipeer works using bluetooth and Wifi communications (P2P) and you need several devices to test it (it also works in the simulator).
